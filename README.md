# An Introduction to Encryption and Learning Cryptography

Cryptography is essential for security. 

It is used to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.

The internet is used by virtually everyone today for trivial purposes such as playing games and more critical tasks such as online banking. 

Users have started using the internet to access and utilize important services. 

A large part of ensuring secure communication is done using Cryptographic primitives. 


# How to run the script
this is the source code used in [*How RSA Cryptosystem WORKS - Intuitive approach*](https://youtu.be/nvcssTsiavg).

## create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- install a venv manager such as [`virtualenv`](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv)
- run `virtualenv .venv`
- active the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` if you are using Bash

## install the dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## run the script
```shell
python rsa.py
```
