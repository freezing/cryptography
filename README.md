# Learning Cryptography through Toy Implementations

<i>This repository contains toy implementations of various cryptographic systems.</i><br>
<i>These implementations are only intended for educational purposes and are not suitable for production.</i>

### Why learn about cryptography?

- It is used to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.
- Cryptography is used for critical tasks such as online banking.  
- A large part of ensuring secure communication is done using Cryptographic primitives.
- Encryption systems like email security and file security widely use asymmetrical cryptography.


# How to run the script
this is the source code used in [**<i>How RSA Cryptosystem WORKS - Intuitive approach</i>**](https://youtu.be/nvcssTsiavg)

## create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- install a venv manager such as [`virtualenv`](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv)
- run `virtualenv .venv`
- active the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` if you are using Bash

## install the dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## run the script
```shell
python rsa.py
```
